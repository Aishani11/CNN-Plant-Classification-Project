# CNN-Plant-Classification-Project
Built a CNN to classify plant seedlings using image data. Preprocessed images with normalization and Gaussian blur, applied data augmentation to prevent overfitting, and trained a deep CNN achieving ~90% accuracy. Model validated with confusion matrix and test predictions.
